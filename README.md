# Machine-Learning-Study-of-Fall-Detection
Machine Learning for Fall Detection.

Utilizing Machine learningâ€™s (ML) potential, I collected 200 fall and non-fall events to train and test five ML-models: Random Forests, Decision Trees, SVM, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Among the 5 ML models,  the Random Forest model achieves the highest accuracy of 97% across most Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) scenarios. This ML-based fall detection system offers personalized monitoring for seniors and saves costs for families and healthcare systems.
